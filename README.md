# Team Profile Generator

This is a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Oftentimes, how we design our code is just as important as the code itself. This Node CLI takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## TODO
